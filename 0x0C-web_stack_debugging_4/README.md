## Webstack Debugging #4
> We are testing how well our web server setup featuring Nginx is doing under pressure and it turns out itâ€™s not doing well: we are getting a huge amount of failed requests. For the benchmarking, we are using ApacheBench which is a quite popular tool in the industry. It allows you to simulate HTTP requests to a web server. In this case, I will make 2000 requests to my server with 100 requests at a time. We can see that 943 requests failed.
```

### Resources:
* [Max open files](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27849331/how-to-set-nginx-max-open-files)

### How to debug:
* Run ApacheBench to simulate requests to server ```ab -c 100 -n 2000 localhost/```
* Look on /var/log/nginx/error.log. for errors and find "accept4() failed (24: Too many open files)"
* Google error message and try different solutions pertaining to resetting max files open limit [1](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-unix-nginx-too-many-open-files/) [2](https://gist.github.com/joewiz/4c39c9d061cf608cb62b)
* Ultimate solution that solved the issue is modifying limit in ```/etc/default/nginx``` file
* Execute puppet script to automate solving issue across magnitude of servers ```puppet apply [0-filename]```

### Environment
* Language: Puppet config script
* OS: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Web Server: Nginx on Docker container
* Style guidelines: Puppet-lint
